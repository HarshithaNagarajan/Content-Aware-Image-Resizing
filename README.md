# Content-Aware-Image-Resizing
## About
This project deals with the implementing of content-aware image resizing using **Seam Carving**. Unlike standard resizing techniques such as cropping or scaling that distort the original image, **seam carving** preserves an imageâ€™s most important features (such as its aspect ratio).

## Technologies used
1. **Python3** - For Dynamic Programming
2. **Tkinter** - For the GUI

## Steps to run the GUI
1. Run the ***GUI.py*** file. This is present in ***Code Files*** -> ***GUI.py***
2. A screen titled *Image Loader* will appear. Upload an image here
3. Choose to either resize via height or width. Enter the appropriate dimensions. Images can be saved after usage
